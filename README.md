# Flow

## Inspiration ðŸŒŠ

Staying in instead of going out, saving on coffee, eating instant ramen everyday, these are all things that we can do to save money and improve our financial health. Sometimes, itâ€™s even what so-called financial gurus suggest to save money for an early retirement. We donâ€™t believe in this type of thinking, so thatâ€™s why we created Flow. We believe that financial health shouldnâ€™t come at the cost of your physical or mental healthâ€”even more so for students.

Many students canâ€™t rely on budgeting apps for a multitude of reasons, which include but are not limited to, changing income and expenses, student tuition and loans, and unexpected expenses. We created Flow to be a more financially flexible and intuitive way to build a budget. 

Students are in a unique place where they are under the constant stress of exams, feeding themselves, and attempting to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So, if you need to spend some money to destress, we support you. We built Flow so that it can help plan your future while helping you stretch every dollar to its last.

## The Features:

Some key features that we wanted to include: the ability to save on subscription plans, being able to cancel any subscription plan with the touch of a button, and to also keep track of your finances no matter how erratic your income is. Hereâ€™s an example of the features in action:

##### Feature 1: Viva La Revolution! (Or not?)

Even the most advanced budgeting apps need to have some key features that allow users to see how much they are spending and to also create plans to save for the future. Our entry survey takes in your income, your expenses, email, and other factors that allows us to generate a quick budget for you to see. We then keep track of your goals and show you your progress to achieving these goals. Keeping in my mind that students often rely on short-term internships to supplement their income, we provide an easy way for users to update any key information that may impact their long-term budget. Additionally, we want to provide users with an easy to understand interface of all their budget breakdowns and how on track they are to meeting their goals.

Feature 2: Cancelling Done Right

Money makes the world spin, even more so if youâ€™re a university student. In between your exams, going out, and trying to find time for extracurriculars, we often rely on subscriptions to help make the most of our time. This could include UberEats, SkipTheDishes, or Amazon Prime, I mean most of us want to make the most out of student deals right? More often than not, companies will hide their cancel button behind a disgusting mess of hidden links, clumped websites, or straight up predatory services. Just take a look at our demo!

You donâ€™t want to deal with this, and neither do we! We leveraged the use of machine learning algorithms to help you deal with this process, and by using a knowledge base of company websites, we are able to directly cancel your subscriptions through your email with a simple click of a button.

Feature 3: Deal or No Deal?

Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll help you figure that out! Student deals are everywhere, you only have to know where to look. Students, the main demographic, simply donâ€™t have the time to look. There are definitely useful subscriptions that help improve your student life immensely and others not so much (Netflixâ€¦). Either way though, weâ€™re here to help you save money. We compare your current plan to other plans and see how you can save money. Donâ€™t worry, you wonâ€™t have to do any work! You simply have to click on the subscription to get a summary of how you could be saving money and then you can hit a button to switch to that plan!
