# Flow

## Inspiration ðŸŒŠ

Staying in instead of going out, saving on coffee, eating instant ramen everyday, these are all things that we can do to save money and improve our financial health. Sometimes, itâ€™s even what so-called financial gurus suggest to save money for an early retirement. We donâ€™t believe in this type of thinking, so thatâ€™s why we created Flow. We believe that financial health shouldnâ€™t come at the cost of your physical or mental healthâ€”even more so for students.

Many students canâ€™t rely on budgeting apps for a multitude of reasons, which include but are not limited to, changing income and expenses, student tuition and loans, and unexpected expenses. We created Flow to be a more financially flexible and intuitive way to build a budget. 

Students are in a unique place where they are under the constant stress of exams, feeding themselves, and attempting to maintain a healthy lifestyle. So, if you need to spend some money to destress, we support you. We built Flow so that it can help plan your future while helping you stretch every dollar to its last.
